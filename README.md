# conTEXTual admin web application

This web application was built by a team of creatives, health experts, and hackers at the 2017 [Ann Arbor Health Hacks](https://www.a2healthhacks.org/) hackathon.

Development of this application was born out of a major problem that hospitals face. Patients that are discharged from the hospital are presented with a thorough treatment plan. For certain patients, the amount of information that they receive can be overwhelming.

conTEXTual is an application that helps nurse educators provide at-risk-for-readmission patients with SMS text-based, programmable reminders that help to reinforce some healthy habits that lead to better treatment outcomes.




#### This web application was built using [angularjs](https://angularjs.org/) 1.5 and communicates with a python flask application.
